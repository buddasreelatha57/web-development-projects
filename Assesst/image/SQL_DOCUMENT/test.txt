    2. where clause optional
    3 group by execute after select.
    4. it can use mrf in where clause
  
4. What is having clause?
   iT IS USED to filter the group by clause
   syntax
   select GROUP FUNCTION/expression
    FROM TABLENAME
   [WHERE <FILTER THE CONDITION>]
    GROUP BY COL_NAME/EXPRESSION
    HAVING <FILTER_GROUP BY _CONDITION>
  
    1. it can use mrf in having clause
    2 after group by clause it execute having clause.
    3.in this where clause also option.
